Numerous reasons sustain my hope. Later in his life, King focused increasingly on economic justice and inclusion. That is a quest we continue today in our work to advance economic mobility and resilience. It is in the best interest of our country not only morally but economically. Holding back some people holds back all of us because it saps our economy of potential.

7/4/2020,"An Independence Day Message from Raphael 

Independence Day 2020 carries some extra meaning for me this year. The day commemorates the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, in which the delegates listed the colonistsâ€™ reasons for fighting to separate from Great Britain. When it was adopted on July 4, 1776, the Declaration was an aspirational document. It codified the emerging nationâ€™s beliefs â€œthat all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.â€

These words echo in my mind often these days, and they are front and center when I reflect on recent events. But they also serve as a reminder that America was born in protest. And on July 4, we celebrate that spirit of standing up against injustice and misrule. As a nation, we continue to strive to live up to that 244-year-old Declaration. Happy Independence Day, everybody! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

3/19/2020,"Christian Zimmerman, CEO and cofounder of Qoins, joined us recently for a new Federal Reserve Board initiative called Innovation Office Hours, which offers face-to-face talks with banks and fintech firms about consumer safety and emerging technologies.

The biggest part of the discussion with Fed staff revolved around the financial literacy aspect of Qoins and payments. Qoins is a financial wellness app that combines financial education with automation. People work with a certified financial coach, make a custom financial plan, and then start automated payments to save and invest.

'Together, we create executable goals for a person to achieve success. We've now done over $10 million in debt paid off. Coming from a background of largely underbanked, underrepresented communities, financial resources have always been there, but people lacked the knowledge to access them,' said Christian. 'Having lived it, having seen my parents struggle, financial education and access is near and dear to my heart. Understanding the Federal Reserve's goals and how they align with my mission was a valuable takeaway from the event.'

They don't have the luxury of going to capital markets to build up buffers to weather these sorts of shocks, so I'm hopeful that the fiscal stimulus that has been passed, and I'm expecting there'll be more actually, will target them and get to those businesses so that they are able to stay in business.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is deeply concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic and its profound effects on the health and well-being of our staff and the citizens of the communities we serve. But even amid this global pandemic, business continues to be transacted.

Recent years have witnessed the introduction of thousands of apps allowing users to make payments and manage their personal finances. These new payment options offer unprecedented convenience, but they also raise new concerns about the safety of our payments and personal data. Lockdowns and concern about infection could increase the use of electronic payments in the long term, and so a deep understanding of these issues can help us make sure the payments system works for everyone.

Payments systems have been evolving since before we entered the arena, and they'll continue to evolve long into the future. We're here to make sure we don't lose sight of why we're pushing for innovation: to help people.
